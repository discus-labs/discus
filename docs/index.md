# Welcome to Discus

**Discus** is a Python library for generating and enriching data using Large Language Models.

Building machine learning models is hard. Discus hopes to alleviate the data problems people encounter so you can spend more time working on your model.

## Features

* Generate high-quality instances and instructions to train or fine-tune LLMs
* Can take an example dataset when generating to create higher quality data
* Use pdfs, csvs, and other forms of unstructured data to help Discus generate your data
* Clean your dataset to reduce replicates, hallucinations, and bias

## Models Supported
* OpenAI
* HuggingFace
