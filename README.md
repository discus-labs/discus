## üè∑ What is Discus

Access to high-quality and large datasets is critical when it comes to ML testing/evaluation. Discus is a Python library that leverages LLM's to generate user guided data to solve this critical problem.

# Get Started with Discus
Here are a few quick steps to get Discus working.

After installing Discus, make sure to integrate in your LLM provider. For example,

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

We can now get started. First, create your json following these guidelines:

* task_name: what you want to call your task
* task_type: the type of data you want to generate. Currently either LLM-Instances or LLM-Instructions
* task_explained: the specific guidelines of your task.
* generated_dataset_name: what you want the returned csv to be called.
* model_provider: the LLM you want to use. Currently only OpenAI.
* model_name: the exact model from your provider.
* number_of_rows: the number of data points you want to generate/enrich

```python
config = {
    "task_name": "English2Spanish",
    "task_type": "LLM-Instances",
    "task_explained": "generate english to spanish translation.", # fill in the blank. "you are trying to _____"
    "generated_dataset_name": "eng2spanish.csv",
    "model_provider": "openai",
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "number_of_rows": "1500"
}
```

To run, import Discus. Then, create a Generator object.

```python
discus = Generator(config = "config_file_path")
generated_data = discus.run()
```

Achieve better results by providing your model with a seed dataset. 

```python
discus = Generator(config = "config_file_path", seed_dataset = "csv_file_path")
generated_data = discus.run()
```
