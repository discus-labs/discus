## üè∑ What is Discus

Access to high-quality and large datasets is critical when it comes to ML testing/evaluation. Discus is a Python library that leverages LLM's to generate user guided data to solve this critical problem. 

Keep up with updates on our [twitter](https://twitter.com/discuslabs) or our [discord](https://discord.gg/t6ADqBKrdZ).

## üöÄ Getting started


In order to use this package, you need to first install it.

```bash
pip install discus
```

Now, you can import the package and set the OpenAI key.

```bash
import discus.openai_utils as utils
import discus.instructions as instructions
import discus.instances as instances
import discus.cleaning as cleaning

utils.set_openai_llm("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

After executing the set_openai_llm function, you will be prompted for input in the console as shown below.

```bash
0: gpt-4-0314
1: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613
2: gpt-3.5-turbo-0301
3: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
4: gpt-4
5: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
6: gpt-3.5-turbo
7: gpt-4-0613
Select the number of your desired model: 5
```
